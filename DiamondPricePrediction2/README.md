End-to-End Diamond Price Prediction System
📄 Project Description:
The traditional diamond valuation process is manual, time-consuming, and prone to human subjectivity. This project solves this problem by automating price estimation based on physical attributes like Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity.
I architected a production-ready Machine Learning system that:
Ingests raw data from various sources.
Transforms data using automated pipelines (handling ordinal encoding and scaling).
Trains a high-accuracy Regression model.
Predicts prices in real-time via a user-friendly Web Interface.
This solution streamlines the valuation process, providing instant and objective price estimates for businesses and buyers.
